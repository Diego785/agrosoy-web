# Progress

What has been done, newest first. Each working session adds an entry, so the next one can pick
up without re-reading the whole history.

## 2026-10-25

- **Workflow change:** no branches or pull requests; steps are committed to `main` in order.
- **0.5 · Database:** Postgres 16 in Docker (`pnpm db:up`, port 5434) with an `agrosoy_test`
  database, Drizzle client with `getDb()` and `withTransaction()`, SQL migrations in `drizzle/`
  applied by `pnpm db:migrate`, the `audit_log` table and its `AuditTrail` port, and the
  integration-test harness (`*.int.test.ts`, tables emptied before each test). CI runs them
  against a Postgres service.
- **0.4 · Tooling**: stricter TypeScript (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), ESLint
  layer rules, Prettier with the Tailwind plugin, Vitest (unit project), `pnpm check`, GitHub Actions CI,
  `.githooks/commit-msg` that strips AI co-author lines, `CLAUDE.md` with the working rules.
- **0.3 · Design docs**: glossary, domain model, decisions D1–D16 and
  the roadmap. Open questions for Agrosoy are listed at the end of the glossary.
- **0.2 · Repository:** Next.js 16.4 base in the private repo `SOLUTI0N-TECH/agrosoy-web`.
- **0.1 · Clean start:** the first exploratory scaffold was removed; it is rebuilt step by step
  following the roadmap.
